# push_swap

This project asks you to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, in as few moves as possible. To succeed, you'll need to manipulate different sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

Here is Turkish algorithm used. Thanks to https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97.
